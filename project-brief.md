# PPT Voice Presenter project brief

**The idea**

Typically we write a talking script for a presentation. I want to create a program that takes can take in the script in text format with some annotations that can add speaking pauses, and slide section pauses, and perhaps even emotion and tone. This text script then gets passed into a series of agents to produce an AI generated presenter audio playback. 

- This should work offline so that the slides do not have to be uploaded to cloud services.
- Check existing application features from Microsoft Powerpoint and Canva
